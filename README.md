# Bubble Sort

Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying data structures and algorithms. The most straight forward is Bubble Sort.

## Theory

Bubble sort works by comparing and possibly swapping two values in a set. Say we start with this set of numbers:

```
1 0 2 3 4 5
```

The algorithm would start with a variable `previous` pointing to the first element,
`1` and `current` pointing to the second value `0`. Then if `current` is
less than `previous` then the two values are *swapped*. The swap would take
place in this case. After that single swap the sequence would be:

```
0 1 2 3 4 5
```

The algorithm would restart with `previous` pointing at the first position and
`current` at the second position. `1` is not less than `0`, so the focus shifts
one spot to the right. `previous` now holds `1` and `current` holds `2`. They
do not need to be swapped. This repeats moving right one space at a time until
reaching the end of the set, meaning the set is sorted.

### Richer Example

Let's look at the sequence for a more out-of-order sequence:

```
Pre-Sequence Previous Current Swap? Post-Sequence

4 3 5 0 1       4        3      Y    3 4 5 0 1
3 4 5 0 1       3        4      N    3 4 5 0 1
3 4 5 0 1       4        5      N    3 4 5 0 1
3 4 5 0 1       5        0      Y    3 4 0 5 1
3 4 0 5 1       3        4      N    3 4 0 5 1
3 4 0 5 1       4        0      Y    3 0 4 5 1
3 0 4 5 1       3        0      Y    0 3 4 5 1
0 3 4 5 1       0        3      N    0 3 4 5 1
0 3 4 5 1       3        4      N    0 3 4 5 1
0 3 4 5 1       4        5      N    0 3 4 5 1
0 3 4 5 1       5        1      Y    0 3 4 1 5
0 3 4 1 5       0        3      N    0 3 4 1 5
0 3 4 1 5       3        4      N    0 3 4 1 5
0 3 4 1 5       4        1      Y    0 3 1 4 5
0 3 1 4 5       0        3      N    0 3 1 4 5
0 3 1 4 5       3        1      Y    0 1 3 4 5
0 1 3 4 5       0        1      N    0 1 3 4 5
0 1 3 4 5       1        3      N    0 1 3 4 5
0 1 3 4 5       3        4      N    0 1 3 4 5
0 1 3 4 5       4        5      N    0 1 3 4 5
0 1 3 4 5       5        nil
```

Once that `nil` pops up in `current` then we're done! We'd say that this run
of the algorithm made `7` swaps.

## Release 0: Write Unit Tests
Always.

## Release 1: Implement It

Write an implementation of bubble sort.

In addition to writing an implementation following the template below, answer
the following questions:

* Given the numbers 0 through 5, what would be the worst case scenario for
bubble sort (aka, what order would necessitate the most swaps)?
* How many swaps would that worst case take?
* The example above took 21 iterations to get to a result. Can you tweak the
algorithm so that it takes the same number of swaps (`7`) but fewer total operations?

## Release 2: Full Collection Passes

The version of bubble sort described above is actually a slightly simplified version of the algorithm which uses a "short-circuiting" approach to making successive iterations. As soon as a number is swapped, go back to the beginning of the list and try again. According to the "real" algorithm, every pass should actually iterate completely through the list, and then decide whether another pass is needed.

See if you can write another, slightly modified, version of the algorithm which follows this pattern. You'll need to add some code to keep track during each pass of whether a swap has been made _any time during that pass_.
